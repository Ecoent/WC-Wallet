It allows you to use credits instead of paying money. The credits are added to the user's wallet from the previous cancelled orders.

== Description ==

If you ever don't want to refund your money instead use as credits for future purchases, here is the plugin. The credits will be added as discount. This plugin is flexible with cart taxes and coupons.

= How it Works =
* A order is made with payment
* When the user insists to cancel the order and the order is cancelled
* Now the order total is not refunded instead added to the user's wallet for future purchase
* The credits will be subracted from the wallet for every purchase, as per credits used.

= Features =
* User Interfaced to add credits at cart page.
* No need to refunds in the gateways.
* Automatic update total when credit is larger the cart total or when product is deleted.
* Send Cancel Order Request and let the admin refund the amount as Credits.
* Credits restrictions for users.
* To show users their balance, use `[wc_wallet_show_balance]` shortcode.
* Offer credits for new users.

1. Ensure you have latest version of WooCommerce plugin installed ( 2.2 or above )
